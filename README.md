  # AI Art Emotion Analysis

  This is a code bundle for AI Art Emotion Analysis. 

When GPT-4o annotated 132,000 artworks – including battle scenes, funeral portraits, and revolutionary unrest—it got stuck in a positivity trap. Across 56 art styles, “calm” appeared in over half the dataset. This project investigates why leading vision–language models interpret violent or chaotic imagery as tranquil. Using statistical tests, color clustering, and cultural stratification, it reveals a 7.5:1 positive-to-negative ratio and finds that Eastern artworks are more frequently marked as positive. A comparison across GPT-4V, Claude-3, and CLIP shows that these patterns are not model-specific but systematic across widely used AI systems. Presented through scrollytelling and interactive visualizations, the project highlights how dataset design, digitization practices, and annotation schemes introduce cultural and emotional blind spots. Rather than optimizing AI for art classification, the findings expose how algorithms reshape our understanding of cultural artifacts by projecting computational notions of “emotion” onto human history.
